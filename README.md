# Landing-Page-Project
Working with existing HTML and CSS code I used Javascript to dynamically add a navigation menu, made it active, and used the "scrollIntoView" method to create a really cool smooth 
scrolling effect when you click on a link in the navigation bar. This project was challenging and fun and I now have a better understanding about dynamic javascript!
